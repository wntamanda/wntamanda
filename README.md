## hi :) i'm amanda  

🎓 CS + Statistics @ LMU Munich  
🌬️ Occasionally found tracking wind patterns instead of sleeping  

I work on projects — sometimes out of curiosity, sometimes out of spite.  
You can see what I’m up to in the pinned repos or on my [portfolio site](https://amandawinata.vercel.app/).
