## hi :) i'm amanda

🎓 CS + Statistics student @ LMU Munich  
🌬️ occasionally found tracking wind patterns instead of sleeping

i build things — sometimes out of curiosity, sometimes out of spite, often just to restore my faith in coding.  
currently knee-deep in:  
- 🔐 quantum-proof ECDSA (yes, it’s a thing)  
- 🤖 optimizing quantum neural networks with a spicy new optimizer  
- ☁️ speedrunning yet another TryHackMe path with snacks and sheer willpower

this profile is half archive, half experiment.  
feel free to poke around, judge my commits, or send cat memes.
